Mexico Earthquake Damage Assessment â€“ Thesis Code:
This repository contains the codebase for the thesis project focused on assessing earthquake-induced building damage in Mexico using U-Net-based models and satellite imagery.

Project Structure:
The repository is organized into four main Jupyter Notebook files:

 1. Preprocessing_dataset.ipynb:
This notebook performs basic preprocessing steps required to prepare the dataset for the U-Net models, particularly the 10-channel version.

 2. Initial_Visualizations.ipynb:
Contains exploratory data analysis and visualizations to better understand the dataset features and distribution.

 3. `channel10_U-Net.ipynb
Implements the 10-channel U-Net model for damage assessment. All required imports and data handling steps are included within the notebook.

 4. 2ndchannelinal.ipynb:
Includes preprocessing steps and the implementation of the 2-channel U-Net model.

Additional Files:
All other files in the repository store the training history for each model across different epochs. These files can be used to analyze model performance over time.

Important Note: Each code file includes the necessary imports and runs independently.
